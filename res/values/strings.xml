    <string name="dynamicUiDescription">Android apps are written in the Java programming language. The Android SDK tools compile your code—along with any data and resource files—into an APK: an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.Once installed on a device, each Android app lives in its own security sandbox:Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.</string>
